# upto10millions

Pseudocde :

    variable1 = 1
        
        WHILE variable is > 10,000,000 :
              variable1 = variable1 + 1
              PRINT x // from 1 to 10,000,00
                  IF variable1 == 10,000,000 :
                      print "Up to ten millions"
                      break counter when variable1 count to 10,000,000
